### What about this huge folder structure ? 🙂

- Download the extension `ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets`
- **package.json** gets updated automatically. It contains record of all the packages in the project. But under **scripts**, we can write some of our own commands.
- Ignore **node_modules, .gitignore, package-lock.json** 😁
- src folder is main which contains the code.
- `reportWebVitals.js` helps us to measure the performance of our project.
- static files such as images are kept under the public folder.
- index.js and app.js under src folder are the main files. 😄
